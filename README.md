# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
In this challenge I created an interactive map using Javascript to show earthquake data from the USGS.gov website.

## About the maps
### Mapbox tile layers
In the maps I created three tile layers that would show a map with the streets details, a satellite view and an outdoors view using the mapbox features.

### Base Layer
In the maps I created three layer groups by defining the names to layer groups so that i could use the d3.json function to pull in all earthquake data, tectonic plate data and Major earthquake data from different sources.

### Using leaflet for map info and visuals
I used leaflet to create a legend at the bottom and to color code the magnitudes of the earthquakes based on its data.

## Conclusion
This module was a difficult one and took a lot of time to understand the concepts. After seeing the examples in the reading and knowing where to pull the functions or what to reference it became a lot easier.
